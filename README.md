## Tech Stack


- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Supabase

## Database Schema Adherence

Included tables:
- `activities`
- `appointment_assignee`
- `appointments`
- `categories`
- `patients`
- `relatives`


### Future Enhancements

Here are suggestions for future improvement:

- **User Management**  
  Introduce a dedicated `users` table with roles (e.g., Pflegekraft, Verwaltung, Admin) for better access control and reliable user references (`created_by`, `appointment_assignee.user`).

- **Audit Logging**  
  Extend the schema with fields like `modified_by`, or integrate a full audit log for better traceability, especially important in healthcare systems.

- **Appointment Conflict Detection**  
  Appointments are not currently validated against staff working hours or overlapping bookings. Introducing a `staff_availability` table and implementing server-side or API-based validation would ensure:
  - Appointments fall within the assigned staffâ€™s available working hours.
  - Staff members are not double-booked for overlapping times.
